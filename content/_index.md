##### Relatively important clarification and a gratitude point


This site was mostly prepared and built by the very amazing, [Dr.Pascal Michaillat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascal-michaillat/) (and partly the amazing "MORITZ-MARIA VON IGELFELD" of the comic book series of Alexander McCall Smith's). Thank you for the amazing hugo demonstration-case and clean documentation. This site is mostly operated using markdown.
